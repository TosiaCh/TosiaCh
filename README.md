## Hi I'm Tosia 🖐️
- 🖥️ 2.5 years ago, I started my journey into computer science, out of curiosity about how technology can solve everyday problems and make life easier.
- 🌍 I’m still exploring my path, and I believe that with more experience, I’ll discover the area where I can feel most fulfilled.
- 📋 Alongside computer science, I’m studying project management, where I’m learning to build a bridge between technology and effective teamwork.
- ⛵ In my free time, I enjoy sailing and working on my creativity through painting. 🎨
